## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant features. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle and employs various machine learning algorithms for prediction.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset:** The project leverages the [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](link_to_dataset) for training and evaluation.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implemented and compared several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were employed to assess the performance of the models.
- **Web App:** A simple web application was developed to showcase the trained model's predictions.
